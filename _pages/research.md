# Research Projects at Laboratropics

**We investigate tools that allow us to move into the future with nature symbiotically**

## Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi
We are currently focusing on the needs of agriculture for better soils by utilisng the already existig arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) of the Far North Queensland region. Promising results have come from other projects and research using the AMs from the Yellow Stone National Park in Wyoming, USA but we intend to show that these marvellous soil cultures are equally abundant in local soils such that there is no risk of introducing harmful organisms to our already at-risk biodiversity.

## Alternative Herbicides
Our efforts to create an alternate herbicide intended to be used safely around pets and children, making for a secondary fertisiler is currently undergoing development and testing. The final goal is for our product *SulfaMate* to be included in local shops for convenient use in home gardens and further commercialisation to allow for safer large-scale weed prevention. Results are currently very promising, both speed and effeciency superceed normally used products and add the secondary effect of working as a fertiliser over months following initial application of the herbicide.
