# Who Are We?
**Laboratropics is a research lab, based out of Cairns in Queensland, investigating our relationships with nature and seek to making use of symbiosis as a means for better living conditions and future prospects**

We are interested in the changes of climate, both on land and in the oceans, the impacts thereof and how we can better monitor such cases to gain a stronger understanding of future trends. The tropics as a whole excites us and we are leading research on speciality organisms of the rainforests which are ready to be utilised for solutions to everyday problems. Aside from agriculture research we are also very interested in progressing the human in its environment by sharing education and knowledge on exciting and vital topics, including basic life, chemistry, biology and medicine which are constantly at the front of our minds.

**Our mission with this organisation is far from simple, as any visionary will tell you, building the future takes time.**

And we are here to work on the level of atomic bonds, peptidal chains and genomic classes. We are bound to designing the strongest solutions based on natural standards. Take for example the issue of sustainability and what one may consider "future proof" is our definition of _natural co-existance capability_ and is practically in this lab. Put in less fragmented terms, all of our efforts will always be mindful of the environment and in regard to exist in generations to come.

Much more could be said but for now while we are in preparation for 2024 so we would rather show results when they are practical to you. So meanwhile make yourself comfortable for healthier times & take care.
